Implement a web-based application for the registration program of Continental University using HTML and JavaScript. The application prompts the user to enter the student type (bachelor or master), residency (in-state or out-state), and number of credits taking for a student. The application then calculates and displays the registration fee, tuition rate (per credit), tuition (tuition rate * credits taking), and total fee (registration fee + tuition).

 

The registration fee is $200 for in-state bachelor student, $600 for out-state bachelor student, $300 for in-state master student, and $900 for out-state master student. The tuition rate (per credit) is $350 for in-state bachelor student, $700 for out-state bachelor student, $450 for in-state master student, and $900 for out-state master student.
